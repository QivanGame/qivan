This guide will cover internal guidelines for making items, and keeping them somewhat consistent.

## Food

Food is categorized into a handful of categories, each with their own quirks.


### Candy

General sweets go here. These restore a little bit of energy, and generally aren't very filling.

#### Out of Combat

These will restore a little bit of health and energy.

#### In Combat

These will generally give some buffs that are physical-related (energy, speed). They might also interact with energy- or speed- adjacent stats.


### Fruit

Fruit-derived foods primarily go here. In general, they'll work a little like sweets - they'll work with your speed and energy, but they might also heal you or give you health-related buffs too.

#### Out of Combat

The "heavier" the item, the more it will affect you. Pies are solid: they'll give a chunk of health. Juice is very sweet, so it'll give a lot of energy. Smaller items like apples will give a little bit of energy, but for the most part they'll scale up depending on the density of the item.

#### In Combat

These will give stat buffs of all kinds. The sweeter the item, the more likely it is to give speed buffs. Mixes might give a little bit of everything.


### Grain

Grains are very hearty: they last a long time in your system and are very energizing.

#### Out of Combat

These restore a lot of energy.

#### In Combat

These will tend to do energy-related things.


### Meat

Meat does a little bit of everything. Depending on the preparation method, it might do more of one thing.

#### Out of Combat

Varies quite a bit, but will generally restore health and energy.

#### In Combat

Varies quite a bit, depending on the preparation style:

- Cooked - brings out the flavor. Generally will just modify some stats.
- Barbecued - adds a tangy burst. Generally will be energy-related.
- Roast - adds a smoky flavor. Generally will be health-related.
- Pan/Fried - adds a bit of oil and flavors. Generally will add an effect or two.
- Baked - adds a bit of controlled cooking. Generally will add an effect and some stats. 
- Souped - put in a stew, soup, or other liquid base. Will generally restore some health.
- Jerked - dried and preserved. Generally will add some abilities, stats, and effects.


### Nuts

Nuts are quick bursts of protein. They're rather filling, but they don't last long.

#### Out of Combat

These will restore a bit of health and energy. Not a lot, but some.

#### In Combat

These will restore a bit of health and energy.

### Vegetable

Vegetables are simple bursts of health in a convenient-sized package. They're not very filling, but they're very healthy.

#### Out of Combat

These will tend to restore a lot of health, and maybe a little energy.

#### In Combat

These will generally heal a bit, and maybe impart some buffs.
