### Basic (simple singe stat modifiers, to be out classed efficiency wise but be solid simple options) p.s. yes they are broken as fuck
    # I think I want skill ability's spaced every 15? or maybe thats silly 
    # for now I think basic at 10 and 30 will be fine and uniques in between at 20 but likely will space them out more
